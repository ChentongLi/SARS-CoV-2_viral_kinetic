# SARS-CoV-2_viral_kinetic

This work is built to estimate the within host R0 of SARS-CoV-2. 

The model and result are pulished on the MBE (Chentong Li, Jinhu Xu, Jiawei Liu, Yicang Zhou.
The within-host viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2[J].Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering (2020) ).

The file CoV_codes are the c code to generate the samples of parameters. 

The File fitplot is the R code to statistically analyze the generated samples.
